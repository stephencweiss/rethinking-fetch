_All_ phases of request from "Not Started" through "Settled" (resolved or rejected)
Handling errors: Knowing _if_ there's an error and what we display when we get an error and what we do when we've resolved the error, e.g., by re-requesting

It's getting more popular.

XState, a tool for modeling state, actually uses a variant as its default State Machine in its visualizer.

How do we handle loading screens?

What about before we even _begin_ loading?

What about errors?

<Slide title={"Why aren't `fetch` or `Axios` enough (by default)?"}>
<ol>
<Steps>
<li>
Consistency
</li>

<li>Testability</li>

</Steps>
</ol>
</Slide>

<Notes>

Let's be clear: Both are great. In fact, we could even use either, but they don't address the problems we're discussing here - at least not natively.

Namely:

Every `fetch` request is configured on its own - no shared patterns. This is about abstracting the common logic.

`Axios` can have shared configuration, but the common practice is to use a Singleton (a shared instance across the entire app) - making testing more difficult

Neither addresses what to do on the client before / after a request is made. They just make the requesting possible.

<Notes>

The logic for a reducer is complicated. When we're managing multiple pieces of state like `isAsked` and `loading` and `data`, etc. - it's easy to get into impossible states

Reducers don't protect against this because they're focused on the final states, not the transitions between states.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had states that couldn't overlap - we'll use RemoteData for this.

Automatic retrying that's easily configurable.

Error handling that ensures that all of our responses - successful or otherwise are handled - which means we have strict typing for errors and success.

<Footnote>

One of my favorite features of XState (and Finite State Machines generally) is how they solve the issue of impossible states by stating explicitly which transitions are allowed.
